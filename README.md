# HashFunction
This was a project I did for a class at SIUc.  BitVector.py is a required file to run the program (https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/dist/BitVector-3.4.4.html).
When the program starts up it asks for a full directory name then the program will create a file called output.txt.
Inside the output.txt will be the name of the files in the directory you specified and thir hash functions.
